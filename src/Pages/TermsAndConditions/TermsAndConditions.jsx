          process. This includes full name, age, contact details, and any other

        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-2">
          <strong>Eligibility:</strong> LITWITS reserves the right to determine
          eligibility for participation in any of its programs based on criteria
          such as age group, skill level, or prior experience. Admission into

          <strong>Program Expectations:</strong> Participants are required to
          attend all sessions, complete all assigned tasks, and actively engage
          in discussions, activities, and projects. Full participation is
          essential to gain the maximum benefit from our programs. Lateness,

        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Attitude and Behavior:</strong> LITWITS fosters a
          collaborative and respectful learning environment. Any disruptive

        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-2">
          <strong>Non-Refundable Payments:</strong> All payments made to LITWITS
          for its programs are final and non-refundable. Once a participant has
          registered and paid the required fee, they are not entitled to any
          refund, whether partial or full, regardless of circumstances. This
          includes but is not limited to situations such as withdrawal from the
          program, failure to attend, or dissatisfaction with the course
          content.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-2">
          <strong>Payment Deadline:</strong> All fees must be paid prior to the
          commencement of the program. LITWITS will not permit access to any
          sessions unless the full fee has been received. Any payment delays may
          result in cancellation of enrollment without refund.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-2">
          <strong>Additional Costs:</strong> Participation in certain
          competitions may require the payment of separate registration or entry
          fees. These costs will be communicated to participants in advance, and
          it is the responsibility of participants or their guardians to cover
          such expenses. Failure to do so may result in exclusion from the
          competition.

          alter the structure, format, schedule, or content of its programs to
          better suit the educational goals of participants or to adapt to
          unforeseen circumstances. This may include changes in instructors,
          session topics, or learning materials. Such changes will be
          communicated to participants as early as possible.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Cancellation of Sessions:</strong> In the event that LITWITS
