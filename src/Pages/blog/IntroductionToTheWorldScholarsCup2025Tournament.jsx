              What is the World Scholar's Cup?
            </h2>
            <p>
              The World Scholar's Cup is an international academic competition
              that inspires school students from ages of 8 to 18 toward a
              passion for learning and collaboration. Established in 2007,
              currently in more than 60 nations, it invites thousands of
              scholars to participate in tournaments, team events, and cultural
              interaction. The World Scholar's Cup puts a high value on
              teamwork, problem-solving, and cross-disciplinary learning that
              yield a wholesome educational experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The competition hosts four major events: Team Debate, Scholar's
              Bowl, Collaborative Writing, and Scholar's Challenge, wherein
              scholars are judged on reasoning, problem-solving, and critical
              thinking skills, compelling them to delve into different topics in
              a fun yet competitive setup.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike the more traditional competitions, the World Scholar's Cup
              encourages collaboration over competitive individualism. The
              emphasis is not on winning but on learning and self-improvement as
              a team. Competitors leave with improved communication skills and
              improved self-confidence.
            </p>
