            <p className="text-black mt-2">
              The story begins over a century ago. In 1920, after the monumental
              devastation of World War I, the League of Nations was established.
              Its purpose was noble: prevent future wars by encouraging dialogue
              and cooperation. But history had other plans.
            </p>
            <p className="text-black mt-2">
              The League lacked authority, key global powers stayed away, and it
              ultimately failed to prevent the second world war. After WWII, the
              world leaders came to a long-overdue realization: that dialogue
              couldn’t just be symbolic. It had to be structured, enforceable,
              and global.
            </p>
            <p className="text-black mt-2">
              Thus, in 1945, the{" "}
              <span className="font-bold text-black">United Nations (UN) </span>{" "}
              was founded. Unlike its predecessor, the UN became an active
              platform for{" "}
              <span className="text-black font-bold">
                peacekeeping, conflict resolution, and international cooperation
                .
              </span>{" "}
              From sending peacekeepers to war-torn regions to leading global
              discussions on climate change, the UN has shaped international
              politics for nearly 80 years now.

              How LITWITS Prepares Students for MUN Success
            </h2>
            <p className="text-black">
              Here’s where <span className="text-black font-bold">LITWITS</span>{" "}
              comes in. We know that while MUN can be thrilling, it can also
              feel overwhelming for beginners. Resolutions, rules of procedure,
              lobbying, moderated caucuses — the jargon itself can be
              intimidating. That’s why we designed a structured mentorship
              program that makes students conference-ready.
            </p>
            <p className="text-black">Here’s how we help:</p>
            <ol className="mb-6 pl-5 text-gray-900 list-decimal list-outside">
              <li className="mb-3 mt-3 text-gray-900">
                <strong>Foundation in International Politics</strong> We start
                by giving students a strong understanding of how the UN works,
                the history of international diplomacy, and the significance of
                peacekeeping. This helps them grasp why MUN exists in the first
                place.
              </li>
              <li className="mb-3 text-gray-900">
                <strong>Research Made Easy</strong> Most students struggle with
                the research phase. At LITWITS, we guide them in analyzing
                country profiles, foreign policy stances, and past UN
                resolutions. By the end, they don’t just “represent” a country —
                they embody its diplomat.
              </li>
              <li className="mb-3 text-gray-900">
                <strong> Resolution Drafting Mastery</strong> Drafting a
                resolution can be the trickiest part of MUN. We break it down
                into clear, simple steps, teaching students how to write
                powerful preambulatory clauses and actionable operative clauses.
                They learn the language of diplomacy — precise, respectful, and
                impactful.
              </li>
              <li className="mb-3 text-gray-900">
                <strong>Mock MUN Sessions</strong> Practice makes perfect. We
                conduct simulated MUN sessions where students debate, lobby, and
                negotiate just like in a real conference. This gives them the
                confidence to handle any situation when they walk into the
                actual committee room.

                <strong> Building Leaders, Not Just Delegates</strong> At
                LITWITS, our goal isn’t just to prepare students for a single
                MUN conference. We want them to walk away with the ability to
                think critically about the world, to argue respectfully, and to
                collaborate with diverse perspectives. In short, we’re building
                leaders who can thrive in a global future.

                  The journey from the League of Nations to the United Nations,
                  and from there to Model United Nations, is more than history.
                  It’s proof that dialogue, negotiation, and collaboration are
                  the foundations of peace.

                  For students, MUN is a stage where they don’t just study these
                  values - they practice them. And with LITWITS mentorship, they
                  do so with confidence, skill, and the mindset of a true
                  diplomat.

                  Because at the end of the day, MUN isn’t just about winning
                  awards. It’s about shaping tomorrow’s leaders - one
                  resolution, one alliance, one confident voice at a time.
