              Understanding the SAT
            </h2>
            <p>
              You should understand the exam structure before beginning with SAT
              preparation. It consists mainly of two major components, which
              include Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW) and Math.
              Reading and Writing assess your capacity to comprehend text and
              interpret it with your grammar knowledge, as well as test your
              analytical skills, but Math tests your algebra expertise along
              with problem-solving skills and data analysis capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should score between 400 and 1600 on the SAT exam, with each
              of the sections being scored on a 200-800 scale. But what exactly
              is a good SAT score? Well, these are set by the universities that
              have their specific requirements regarding the acceptance of SAT
              scores. Your admission success depends on the score you attain on
              the SAT exam. Thus, based on the university you want to get
              admitted to, you should set a realistic score target and follow a
              proper SAT prep guide to achieve it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best way to succeed in the test is to study the official
              materials and good SAT preparation books to understand the format.
              Frequent practice tests reveal your skills and gaps in your
              practice. Your knowledge growth, time management, and increased
              confidence will result in your improved performance in the exam.
              Good familiarity with the SAT structure can make your path to SAT
              preparation 2025 a success.

              When to Start Preparing?
            </h2>
            <div className="flex justify-center items-center mb-12">
              <img

              />
            </div>
            <p>
              When you start with SAT preparation, you must consider checking
              your efficiency in specific subjects, like reading, writing, and
              mathematics. However, you should work efficiently to meet your
              school deadlines as well. It will take you around 6-12 months to
              score good marks in the exam. So, start with early preparation
              because it helps you undergo detailed concept learning and
              frequent practice tests, which give you opportunities to improve
              on your weaknesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Balancing SAT preparation during your 10th or early 11th-grade
              year enables you to manage your schoolwork duties alongside
              extracurricular activities. A structured SAT study plan 2025 will
              enable you to be consistent without burning out. On the other
              hand, if you are studying in Grade 12 and only have minimal time
              at hand, choose an intensive SAT prep 2025 course to gain
              quick-focused learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Designing your study schedule effectively represents the main
              strategy for success. You should allocate time for each section,
              such as reading, writing, and math, focusing on all your strengths
              and weaknesses. The official SAT preparation materials, along with
              complete mock tests, help create realistic test simulations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maintaining steady and regular practice stands as your most
              crucial factor when preparing for the SAT. The combination of
              continued practice, error analysis, and strategy improvements will
              make your scores grow steadily. Applying the correct strategy will
              enable you to build consistent improvement until you achieve
              confidence for your test day. Your immediate preparations will
              lead to success in the SAT preparation 2025!
