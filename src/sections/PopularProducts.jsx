                Driven by a mission to build leaders, LITWITS has redefined the
                education landscape by fostering critical thinking, and the
                power of inquiry.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-white leading-relaxed text-left lg:text-xl mb-6">
                For over a decade, LITWITS has empowered more than 10,000
                students to engage in reflective inquiry, deepen their
                perspectives and become catalysts for meaningful change.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-white leading-relaxed text-left mb-4 lg:text-xl">
                LITWITS students' ability to think critically, formulate deep
                and effective questions has led to LITWITS being home to the
                best speakers, debaters, and writers who become leaders with a
                conscience.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-white leading-relaxed text-left lg:text-xl">
                With a legacy of excellence, LITWITS students have consistently
                excelled at leading global competitions, including the Harvard
                Online Debate, Harvard International Review, Edinburgh BP World
                Cup, Yale University, and the Stanford Invitational. At the
                World Scholarâ€™s Cup, our delegations have repeatedly ranked
                among the top, with notable performances across India, Beijing,
                Dubai, Doha, Melbourne, The Hague, Bangkok, Vietnam, Kuala
                Lumpur, and Yale. Students from around the world turn to the
                LITWITS platform as they shape themselves into the next
                generation of thoughtful, visionary leaders.
